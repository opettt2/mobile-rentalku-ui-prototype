# 🚗 Rentalku — Mobile Car Rental App (UI/UX Prototype)

Rentalku is a mobile UI prototype for a vehicle rental platform that enables users to browse cars, compare rental providers, select rental dates, and complete payment — all through a seamless mobile experience.  
This design focuses on simplicity, clarity, and a modern rental-flow similar to platforms like Traveloka & Tiket.

> 🎨 Designed in Figma as a mobile-first experience.
